Chapter 1: What is XP?
============

XP is focused on the excellent application of:
-	Programming techniques
-	Clear communication
-	Teamwork

XP includes:
-	A PHILOSOPHY of SW development based on the the VALUES of communication, feedback, simplicity, courage, and respect.
		
-	A body of PRACTICES proven useful in improving SW development.  The practices complement each other, amplifying their effects.  They are chosen as expressions of the VALUES.
		
-	A set of complementary PRINCIPLES, intellectural techniques for translating the VALUES into PRACTICE, useful when there isn't a practice handy for your particular problem.
		
-	A COMMUNITY that shares these VALUES and many of the same PRACTICES.
		
XP is a path to excellence for people coming together to develop SW.  It is distinguished from other methodologies by:
	Short development cycles, resulting in early, concrete, and continuing feedback.
	
-	An incremental planning approach, which quickly comes up with an overall plan that is expected to evolve through the life of the project.
	
-	The ability to flexibly schedule the implementation of functionality, responding to changing business needs.
	
-	Reliance on automated tests written by programmers, customers, and testers to monitor progress of development, to allow the system to evolve, and to catch defects (bugs) early.
	
-	Reliance on oral communication, tests, and source code to communicate system structure and intent.
	
-	Reliance on an evolutionary design process that lasts as long as the system lasts.
	
-	Reliance on the close collaboration of actively engaged individuals with ordinary talent.
	
-	Reliance on practices that work with both the short-term instincts of the team, and the long term interests of the project.
	
The author describes XP this way:
-	XP is lightweight.  In XP, you only do what you need to do to create value for the customer.  You can't carry a lot of baggage and move fast.  However, there is no freeze-dried SW process. The body of technical knowledge required to be an outstanding team is large and growing.
	
-	XP is a methodology based on addressing constraints on SW development.  It does not address project portfolio management, financial justification of projects, operations, marketing, or sales.  XP has implications in all of these areas, but does not address these practices directly.  Methodology is often interpreted to mean "a set of rules to follow to guarantee success."  Methodologies don't work like programs.  People aren't computers.  Every team does XP differently with varying degrees of success.
	
-	XP can work with teams of any size.  XP has been put into use in a wide range of projects and has been successful for both large and small projects and teams.  The values and principles behind XP are applicable at any scale.  The practices need to be augmented and altered when many people get involved.
	
-	XP adapts to vague or rapidly changing requirements.  XP is still good for this situation, which is fortunate because requirements need to change to adapt to rapid shifts in the modern business world.  However, teams have also successfully used XP where requirements don't seem volatile, like porting projects.
