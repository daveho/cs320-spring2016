Chapter 1: What is XP?
============

XP is focused on the excellent application of:
-	Programming techniques
-	Clear communication
-	Teamwork

XP includes:

-	A PHILOSOPHY of SW development based on the the VALUES of communication, feedback, simplicity, courage, and respect.
		
-	A body of PRACTICES proven useful in improving SW development.  The practices complement each other, amplifying their effects.  They are chosen as expressions of the VALUES.
		
-	A set of complementary PRINCIPLES, intellectural techniques for translating the VALUES into PRACTICE, useful when there isn't a practice handy for your particular problem.
		
-	A COMMUNITY that shares these VALUES and many of the same PRACTICES.
		
XP is a path to excellence for people coming together to develop SW.  It is distinguished from other methodologies by:

-	Short development cycles, resulting in early, concrete, and continuing feedback.
	
-	An incremental planning approach, which quickly comes up with an overall plan that is expected to evolve through the life of the project.
	
-	The ability to flexibly schedule the implementation of functionality, responding to changing business needs.
	
-	Reliance on automated tests written by programmers, customers, and testers to monitor progress of development, to allow the system to evolve, and to catch defects (bugs) early.
	
-	Reliance on oral communication, tests, and source code to communicate system structure and intent.
	
-	Reliance on an evolutionary design process that lasts as long as the system lasts.
	
-	Reliance on the close collaboration of actively engaged individuals with ordinary talent.
	
-	Reliance on practices that work with both the short-term instincts of the team, and the long term interests of the project.
	
The author describes XP this way:

-	XP is lightweight.  In XP, you only do what you need to do to create value for the customer.  You can't carry a lot of baggage and move fast.  However, there is no freeze-dried SW process. The body of technical knowledge required to be an outstanding team is large and growing.
	
-	XP is a methodology based on addressing constraints on SW development.  It does not address project portfolio management, financial justification of projects, operations, marketing, or sales.  XP has implications in all of these areas, but does not address these practices directly.  Methodology is often interpreted to mean "a set of rules to follow to guarantee success."  Methodologies don't work like programs.  People aren't computers.  Every team does XP differently with varying degrees of success.
	
-	XP can work with teams of any size.  XP has been put into use in a wide range of projects and has been successful for both large and small projects and teams.  The values and principles behind XP are applicable at any scale.  The practices need to be augmented and altered when many people get involved.
	
-	XP adapts to vague or rapidly changing requirements.  XP is still good for this situation, which is fortunate because requirements need to change to adapt to rapid shifts in the modern business world.  However, teams have also successfully used XP where requirements don't seem volatile, like porting projects.

The author claims that XP addresses risk at all levels of SW development:

-	Schedule slips - XP calls for short release cycles, a few months at most, so the scope of any slip is limited.  Within a release, XP uses one-week iterations of customer-requested features to create fine-grained feedback about progress.  Within an iteration, XP plans with short tasks, so the team can solve problems during the cycle.  Finally, XP calls for implementing the highest priority features first, so any features that slip past the release will be of a lower value.
	
-	Project cancellation - XP asks the business-oriented part of the team to choose the smallest release that makes the most business sense, so there is less that can go wrong before deploying, and the value of the SW is greatest.
	
-	System goes sour - XP creates and maintains a comprehensive suite of automated tests, which are run and rerun after every change (many times a day) to ensure a quality baseline.  XP always keeps the system in a deployable condition.  Problems are not allowed to accumulate.
	
-	Defect rate - XP tests from the perspective of both programmers writing tests function-by-function and customers writing tests program-feature-by-program-feature.
	
-	Business misunderstood - XP calls for business-oriented people to be first-class members of the team.  The specification of the project is continuously refined during development, so learning by the customer and the team is reflected in the SW.
	
-	Business changes - XP shortens the release cycle, so there is less change during the develpment of a single release.  During a release, the customer is welcome to substitute new functionality for functionality not yet completed.  The team doesn't even notice if it is working on newly discovered functionality or features defined years ago.
	
-	False feature rich - XP insists that only the highest priority tasks are addressed.
	
-	Staff turnover - XP asks programmers to accept responsibility for estimating and completing their own work, gives them feedback about the actual time taken so their estimates can improve, and respects those estimates.  The rules for who can make and change estimates are clear.  Thus, there is less chance for a programmer to get frustrated by being asked to do the obviously impossible.  XP also encourages human contact among the team, reducing the loneliness that is often at the heart of job dissatisfaction.  Finally, XP incorporates an explicit model of staff turnover: new team members are encouraged to gradually accept more and more responsibility, and are assisted along the way by each other and by existing programmers.
	
The author then states a collection of assumptions that XP makes:

-	XP assumes that you see yourself as part of a team, ideally one with clear goals and a plan of execution.
-	XP assumes that you want to work together.
-	XP assumes that change can be inexpensive using this method.
-	XP assumes that you want to grow, to improve your skills,and to improve your relationships.
-	XP assumes that you are willing to make changes to meet those goals.
		
Finally, the author summarizes XP this way:

-	XP is giving up old, ineffective technical and social habits in favor of new ones that work.
-	XP is fully appreciating yourself for total effort today.
-	XP is striving to do better tomorrow.
-	XP is evaluating yourself by your contributions to the team's shared goals.
-	XP is asking you to get some of your human needs met through SW development.

Chapter 1: Discussion Points
============

-	We will first discuss XP (as described above) in relation to the Waterfall Model example to be presented in the previous lecture, assuming that XP could be applied to that project.

-	The author makes a lot of claims about XP, as well as states many qualities that XP possesses, including addressing human factors.  He makes it sound like a lifestyle.  Discuss your reaction to what the author has to say in the first chapter about XP?

-	The author makes this statement about estimates and expectations:
"If you have six weeks to get a project done, the only thing you control is your own behavior.  Will you get six weeks' worth of work done, or less?  You can't control others' expectation.  You can tell them what you know about the project so that their expectations have a chance of matching reality.  My terror of deadlines vanished when I learned this lesson.  It's not my job to "manage" someone else's expectations.  It's their job to manage their own expectations.  It's my job to do my best and to communicate clearly."

-	Who determines how much work is "six weeks' worth of work"?  What if your manager (or your professor) imposes unreasonable/impossible deadlines on you (and/or your team)?  How do you put the author's statement into practice?  There is an inherent conflict here, and imbalance of "power", skewed far to side of the manager.  What do you do to deal with it?  How should a team that is responsible for setting its own estimates deal with the rejection of those estimates?
